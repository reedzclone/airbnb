              Abbe&apos;s place was so wonderful and just what I needed. It was
              the perfect escape with a great wood stove, beautiful views,
              horses, and nearby skiing. I&apos;m so grateful.

              The location was very quiet and peaceful. We loved the wood stove
              and the location was convenient, however the interior was not in
              the best shape.

              Overall a decent stay. I appreciated having a kitchen and access
              to firewood for the stove which heated up the little cabin very
              effectively.

              Abbeâ€™s tiny house was a perfect spot to spend the weekend while
              skiing in the Tetons. The space was comfortable and the wood stove
              kept us very warm.
